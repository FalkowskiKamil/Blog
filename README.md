This is a Flask web application for a blog. The app has the following features:

    Users can create, edit, and delete blog posts.
    Users can view a list of drafts that they have created.
    Users can log in to the application with a username and password.
    The application requires users to log in before they can create, edit, or delete blog posts.
    The application uses SQLAlchemy to interact with a SQLite database.
    The application uses WTForms to validate form input from users.

The configuration settings for the app are specified in config.py, and the main Flask application is initialized in blog.py. The routes.py module contains the various routes that handle HTTP requests to the application. The models.py module defines the SQLAlchemy model for the blog post entries. The forms.py module defines the WTForms forms used in the application. Finally, the generate_entries.py script generates fake blog posts for testing purposes.
